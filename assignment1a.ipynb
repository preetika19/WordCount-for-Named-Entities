Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun;\",\n 'I\\'m sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels',\n 'of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.',\n '',\n '\"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when',\n 'I\\'m longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone',\n 'again.',\n '',\n '\"You don\\'t have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you',\n 'like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps',\n \"you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\",\n 'fly out of the window or cry?\"',\n '',\n '\"It\\'s naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things',\n 'tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get',\n 'so stiff, I can\\'t practise well at all;\" and Beth looked at her rough',\n 'hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.',\n '',\n '\"I don\\'t believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy; \"for you don\\'t',\n \"have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't\",\n 'know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if',\n 'he isn\\'t rich, and insult you when your nose isn\\'t nice.\"',\n '',\n '\"If you mean _libel_, I\\'d say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if',\n 'papa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.',\n '',\n '\"I know what I mean, and you needn\\'t be _statirical_ about it. It\\'s',\n 'proper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_,\" returned Amy,',\n 'with dignity.',\n '',\n '\"Don\\'t peck at one another, children. Don\\'t you wish we had the money',\n \"papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we'd be,\",\n 'if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.',\n '',\n '\"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the',\n 'King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in',\n 'spite of their money.\"',\n '',\n '\"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,',\n 'we make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"',\n '',\n '\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at',\n 'the long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her',\n 'hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.',\n '',\n '\"Don\\'t, Jo; it\\'s so boyish!\"',\n '',\n '\"That\\'s why I do it.\"',\n '',\n '\"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!\"',\n '',\n '\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"',\n '',\n '\"\\'Birds in their little nests agree,\\'\" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with',\n 'such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the',\n '\"pecking\" ended for that time.',\n '',\n '\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to',\n 'lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off',\n \"boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much\",\n 'when you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your',\n 'hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"',\n '',\n '\"I\\'m not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I\\'ll wear it in two',\n 'tails till I\\'m twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down',\n 'a chestnut mane. \"I hate to think I\\'ve got to grow up, and be Miss',\n \"March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It's bad\",\n \"enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and\",\n \"manners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it's\",\n \"worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with papa, and I can\",\n 'only stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!\" And Jo shook the',\n 'blue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball',\n 'bounded across the room.',\n '',\n '\"Poor Jo! It\\'s too bad, but it can\\'t be helped; so you must try to be',\n 'contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us',\n 'girls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that',\n 'all the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in',\n 'its touch.',\n '',\n '\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular and',\n \"prim. Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an affected little\",\n \"goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways\",\n \"of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but your absurd words are\",\n 'as bad as Jo\\'s slang.\"',\n '',\n '\"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,',\n 'ready to share the lecture.',\n '',\n '\"You\\'re a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly; and no one',\n 'contradicted her, for the \"Mouse\" was the pet of the family.',\n '',\n 'As young readers like to know \"how people look,\" we will take this',\n 'moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat',\n 'knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly',\n 'without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable',\n 'old room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for',\n 'a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,',\n 'chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a',\n 'pleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.',\n '',\n 'Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being',\n 'plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet',\n 'mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old',\n 'Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she',\n 'never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very',\n 'much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,',\n 'gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,',\n 'funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it',\n 'was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders',\n 'had Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the',\n 'uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a',\n \"woman, and didn't like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\",\n 'her--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy',\n 'manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom',\n 'disturbed. Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name',\n 'suited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her',\n 'own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,',\n 'though the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at',\n 'least. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling',\n 'on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a',\n 'young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four',\n 'sisters were we will leave to be found out.',\n '',\n 'The clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair',\n 'of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good',\n 'effect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened',\n 'to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out',\n 'of the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was',\n 'as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.',\n '',\n '        [Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]',\n '',\n '\"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair.\"',\n '',\n '\"I thought I\\'d get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.',\n '',\n '\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.',\n '',\n '\"I\\'m the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--',\n '',\n '\"I\\'m the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the',\n 'slippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was',\n 'gone.\"',\n '',\n '\"I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do,\" said Beth; \"let\\'s each get her something',\n 'for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"',\n '',\n '\"That\\'s like you, dear! What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.',\n '',\n 'Every one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the',\n 'idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give',\n 'her a nice pair of gloves.\"',\n '',\n '\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.',\n '',\n '\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.',\n '',\n '\"I\\'ll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won\\'t cost',\n 'much, so I\\'ll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.',\n '',\n '\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.',\n '',\n '\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.',\n 'Don\\'t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.',\n '',\n '        [Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my',\n '                     turn to sit in the big chair]',\n '',\n '\"I used to be _so_ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big',\n 'chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the',\n 'presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was',\n 'dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\" said',\n 'Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.',\n '',\n '\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise',\n 'her. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to',\n 'do about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up and down,',\n 'with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.',\n '',\n '\"I don\\'t mean to act any more after this time; I\\'m getting too old for',\n 'such things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about',\n '\"dressing-up\" frolics.',\n '',\n '\"You won\\'t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown',\n 'with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best',\n \"actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\",\n 'boards,\" said Jo. \"We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do',\n 'the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"',\n '',\n '\"I can\\'t help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don\\'t choose to make',\n 'myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down',\n \"easily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\",\n 'graceful; I don\\'t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\" returned',\n 'Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she',\n 'was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.',\n '',\n '          [Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]',\n '',\n '\"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,',\n 'crying frantically, \\'Roderigo! save me! save me!\\'\" and away went Jo,',\n 'with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.',\n '',\n 'Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked',\n 'herself along as if she went by machinery; and her \"Ow!\" was more',\n 'suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave',\n 'a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread',\n 'burn as she watched the fun, with interest.',\n '',\n '\"It\\'s no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the',\n 'audience laugh, don\\'t blame me. Come on, Meg.\"',\n '',\n 'Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of',\n 'two pages without a single break; Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful',\n 'incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;',\n 'Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of',\n 'remorse and arsenic, with a wild \"Ha! ha!\"',\n '',\n '\"It\\'s the best we\\'ve had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and',\n 'rubbed his elbows.',\n '',\n '\"I don\\'t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You\\'re',\n 'a regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her',\n 'sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.',\n '',\n '\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly. \"I do think \\'The Witch\\'s Curse, an',\n \"Operatic Tragedy,' is rather a nice thing; but I'd like to try Macbeth,\",\n 'if we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing',\n 'part. \\'Is that a dagger that I see before me?\\'\" muttered Jo, rolling her',\n 'eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.',\n '',\n '\"No, it\\'s the toasting fork, with mother\\'s shoe on it instead of the',\n 'bread. Beth\\'s stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a',\n 'general burst of laughter.',\n '',\n '\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,',\n 'and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady, with a',\n '\"can-I-help-you\" look about her which was truly delightful. She was not',\n 'elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the',\n 'gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in',\n 'the world.',\n '',\n '\"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,',\n \"getting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn't come home to\",\n 'dinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look',\n 'tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\"',\n '',\n 'While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off,',\n 'her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy-chair, drew Amy to',\n 'her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls',\n 'flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg',\n 'arranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,',\n 'overturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and',\n 'fro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave',\n 'directions to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.',\n '',\n 'As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly',\n 'happy face, \"I\\'ve got a treat for you after supper.\"',\n '',\n 'A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped',\n 'her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her',\n 'napkin, crying, \"A letter! a letter! Three cheers for father!\"',\n '',\n '\"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through',\n 'the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving',\n 'wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.',\n 'March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.',\n '',\n '\"Hurry and get done!

Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun;\",\n 'I\\'m sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels',\n 'of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.',\n '',\n '\"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when',\n 'I\\'m longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone',\n 'again.',\n '',\n '\"You don\\'t have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you',\n 'like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps',\n \"you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\",\n 'fly out of the window or cry?\"',\n '',\n '\"It\\'s naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things',\n 'tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get',\n 'so stiff, I can\\'t practise well at all;\" and Beth looked at her rough',\n 'hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.',\n '',\n '\"I don\\'t believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy; \"for you don\\'t',\n \"have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't\",\n 'know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if',\n 'he isn\\'t rich, and insult you when your nose isn\\'t nice.\"',\n '',\n '\"If you mean _libel_, I\\'d say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if',\n 'papa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.',\n '',\n '\"I know what I mean, and you needn\\'t be _statirical_ about it. It\\'s',\n 'proper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_,\" returned Amy,',\n 'with dignity.',\n '',\n '\"Don\\'t peck at one another, children. Don\\'t you wish we had the money',\n \"papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we'd be,\",\n 'if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.',\n '',\n '\"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the',\n 'King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in',\n 'spite of their money.\"',\n '',\n '\"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,',\n 'we make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"',\n '',\n '\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at',\n 'the long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her',\n 'hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.',\n '',\n '\"Don\\'t, Jo; it\\'s so boyish!\"',\n '',\n '\"That\\'s why I do it.\"',\n '',\n '\"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!\"',\n '',\n '\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"',\n '',\n '\"\\'Birds in their little nests agree,\\'\" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with',\n 'such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the',\n '\"pecking\" ended for that time.',\n '',\n '\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to',\n 'lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off',\n \"boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much\",\n 'when you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your',\n 'hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"',\n '',\n '\"I\\'m not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I\\'ll wear it in two',\n 'tails till I\\'m twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down',\n 'a chestnut mane. \"I hate to think I\\'ve got to grow up, and be Miss',\n \"March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It's bad\",\n \"enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and\",\n \"manners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it's\",\n \"worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with papa, and I can\",\n 'only stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!\" And Jo shook the',\n 'blue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball',\n 'bounded across the room.',\n '',\n '\"Poor Jo! It\\'s too bad, but it can\\'t be helped; so you must try to be',\n 'contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us',\n 'girls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that',\n 'all the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in',\n 'its touch.',\n '',\n '\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular and',\n \"prim. Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an affected little\",\n \"goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways\",\n \"of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but your absurd words are\",\n 'as bad as Jo\\'s slang.\"',\n '',\n '\"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,',\n 'ready to share the lecture.',\n '',\n '\"You\\'re a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly; and no one',\n 'contradicted her, for the \"Mouse\" was the pet of the family.',\n '',\n 'As young readers like to know \"how people look,\" we will take this',\n 'moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat',\n 'knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly',\n 'without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable',\n 'old room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for',\n 'a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,',\n 'chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a',\n 'pleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.',\n '',\n 'Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being',\n 'plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet',\n 'mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old',\n 'Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she',\n 'never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very',\n 'much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,',\n 'gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,',\n 'funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it',\n 'was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders',\n 'had Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the',\n 'uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a',\n \"woman, and didn't like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\",\n 'her--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy',\n 'manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom',\n 'disturbed. Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name',\n 'suited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her',\n 'own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,',\n 'though the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at',\n 'least. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling',\n 'on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a',\n 'young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four',\n 'sisters were we will leave to be found out.',\n '',\n 'The clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair',\n 'of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good',\n 'effect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened',\n 'to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out',\n 'of the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was',\n 'as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.',\n '',\n '        [Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]',\n '',\n '\"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair.\"',\n '',\n '\"I thought I\\'d get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.',\n '',\n '\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.',\n '',\n '\"I\\'m the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--',\n '',\n '\"I\\'m the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the',\n 'slippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was',\n 'gone.\"',\n '',\n '\"I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do,\" said Beth; \"let\\'s each get her something',\n 'for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"',\n '',\n '\"That\\'s like you, dear! What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.',\n '',\n 'Every one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the',\n 'idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give',\n 'her a nice pair of gloves.\"',\n '',\n '\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.',\n '',\n '\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.',\n '',\n '\"I\\'ll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won\\'t cost',\n 'much, so I\\'ll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.',\n '',\n '\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.',\n '',\n '\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.',\n 'Don\\'t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.',\n '',\n '        [Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my',\n '                     turn to sit in the big chair]',\n '',\n '\"I used to be _so_ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big',\n 'chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the',\n 'presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was',\n 'dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\" said',\n 'Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.',\n '',\n '\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise',\n 'her. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to',\n 'do about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up and down,',\n 'with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.',\n '',\n '\"I don\\'t mean to act any more after this time; I\\'m getting too old for',\n 'such things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about',\n '\"dressing-up\" frolics.',\n '',\n '\"You won\\'t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown',\n 'with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best',\n \"actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\",\n 'boards,\" said Jo. \"We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do',\n 'the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"',\n '',\n '\"I can\\'t help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don\\'t choose to make',\n 'myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down',\n \"easily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\",\n 'graceful; I don\\'t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\" returned',\n 'Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she',\n 'was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.',\n '',\n '          [Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]',\n '',\n '\"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,',\n 'crying frantically, \\'Roderigo! save me! save me!\\'\" and away went Jo,',\n 'with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.',\n '',\n 'Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked',\n 'herself along as if she went by machinery; and her \"Ow!\" was more',\n 'suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave',\n 'a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread',\n 'burn as she watched the fun, with interest.',\n '',\n '\"It\\'s no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the',\n 'audience laugh, don\\'t blame me. Come on, Meg.\"',\n '',\n 'Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of',\n 'two pages without a single break; Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful',\n 'incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;',\n 'Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of',\n 'remorse and arsenic, with a wild \"Ha! ha!\"',\n '',\n '\"It\\'s the best we\\'ve had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and',\n 'rubbed his elbows.',\n '',\n '\"I don\\'t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You\\'re',\n 'a regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her',\n 'sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.',\n '',\n '\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly. \"I do think \\'The Witch\\'s Curse, an',\n \"Operatic Tragedy,' is rather a nice thing; but I'd like to try Macbeth,\",\n 'if we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing',\n 'part. \\'Is that a dagger that I see before me?\\'\" muttered Jo, rolling her',\n 'eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.',\n '',\n '\"No, it\\'s the toasting fork, with mother\\'s shoe on it instead of the',\n 'bread. Beth\\'s stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a',\n 'general burst of laughter.',\n '',\n '\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,',\n 'and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady, with a',\n '\"can-I-help-you\" look about her which was truly delightful. She was not',\n 'elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the',\n 'gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in',\n 'the world.',\n '',\n '\"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,',\n \"getting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn't come home to\",\n 'dinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look',\n 'tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\"',\n '',\n 'While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off,',\n 'her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy-chair, drew Amy to',\n 'her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls',\n 'flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg',\n 'arranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,',\n 'overturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and',\n 'fro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave',\n 'directions to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.',\n '',\n 'As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly',\n 'happy face, \"I\\'ve got a treat for you after supper.\"',\n '',\n 'A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped',\n 'her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her',\n 'napkin, crying, \"A letter! a letter! Three cheers for father!\"',\n '',\n '\"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through',\n 'the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving',\n 'wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.',\n 'March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.',\n '',\n '\"Hurry and get done!
